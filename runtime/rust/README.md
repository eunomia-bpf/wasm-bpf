## ðŸ“¦ [Wasm-bpf: Wasm library and toolchain for eBPF](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf)

[`Wasm-bpf`](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf) is a WebAssembly eBPF library, toolchain and runtime powered by [CO-RE](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html)(Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere) [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf). It can help you build almost every eBPF programs or usecases to `Wasm`.

### Features

- **`General purpose`**: provide most abilities from eBPF to Wasm, `polling` from the ring buffer or perf buffer, bidirectional communications between `kernel` eBPF and `userspace` Wasm using `maps`, dynamically `loading`, `attaching` or `detaching`, etc. Supports a large number of eBPF program types and map types.
- **`High performance`**: No `serialization` overhead for complex data types, using `shared memory` to avoid copy overhead between host and Wasm.
- **`Easy to use`**: provide a similar developing experience as the [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap), `auto generate` the Wasm-eBPF skeleton headers and type definitions for bindings.
- **`Ultralightweight`**: the sample runtime has only `1.5 MB` in binary size. Compiled Wasm module would be only `~90K`. With the same toolchain, you can easily build your own Wasm-eBPF runtime in any languages and platforms!

See the [examples](examples) directory for examples of eBPF programs written in C, Rust and compiled to Wasm, covering the use cases from `tracing`, `networking` to `security`.
